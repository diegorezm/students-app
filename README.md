# API
Api made with express and PostgreSql. All you would have to do to run it would be: 
* Create an account on [elephantsql](https://www.elephantsql.com/) and there create an instance, the name does not matter.
* Run the following command (on Linux/Mac):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/diegorezm/students-app && cd api && touch .env
    ```
* Create the environmental variables:
  * **DB_URL='DB_URL'**
  * **PORT='YOUR_PORT'**
  * **TOKEN_SECRET='YOUR_PASSWORD'**

This sould get the api running.
